            "Our pioneering design gives the new GT a unique beauty and balance. The profile is sleek but purposeful. This is a car that invites you to drive. Traditional Grand Tourers are slower. Heavier. And simply less fun to drive. But this is the comfort of a GT married with the performance of a McLaren supercar. The cabin is acutely modern – a masterpiece of tactile luxury. There’s our infotainment system. Immaculately trimmed luggage space. And finely crafted details throughout. On the exterior, the sculpted rear haunches house the vital air intakes. A totally flat underbody helps to generate downforce for incredible high-speed stability. Beneath the fluid surfaces you’ll find the innovative design and engineering that’s at the heart of every McLaren.",

Well, those rules are history. The GT’s strong, stiff carbon fibre structure combines with our latest active suspension for true comfort – without the traditional weight penalties. There’s also ample room under the full length, glazed, powered tailgate. And in the front storage area. So your luggage – from golf clubs, to skis– simply fit… with space to spare.

With a powerful presence and aggressive design language that deliver incredible performance. Less weight. More downforce. Aerodynamic innovation. Bespoke carbon fibre body panels shape an iconic elongated profile. Suspension is lowered. And the front track is wider. The message is clear: nothing gets in the way of dynamic ability. Everything is here for a reason. Inside the 765LT, the unblinking sense of purpose and minimal clarity continue. There’s lightweight Alcantara®. And the seats used in the awe-inspiring McLaren P1™. Sculpted carbon fibre is everywhere. The Longtail story continues.",

            "Lighter is faster. And it begins with MonoCage II. An immensely strong, stiff, ultra-light chassis at the heart of each McLaren super car. It’s a perfect base for radical weight saving. New carbon fibre body panels, motorsport-inspired polycarbonate glazing, a unique and dramatic titanium exhaust system, light dual-spring suspension… Longtail DNA is woven into everything. The result is a light supercar that weighs 80kg less than the immensely lean 720S. Settle into the lightweight seats within the sculpted, ultra-functional cabin and you’re surrounded by more innovative, engineered lightness. The carbon fibre centre tunnel is bespoke. Anything not connected to driver focus or track focus is gone. So there’s no air conditioning. Or carpeting. Or audio system. Less is more never felt so real and vivid. The 765LT can be specified to just 1,229kg in dry form. And has a class-leading power-to-weight ratio of 622PS per tonne. Numbers that must be experienced to be appreciated.",

Beyond blistering performance and inspiring chassis dynamics, engagement is heightened in many ways. Sensitive tactile electro-hydraulic steering now has an even quicker rack. And a stiffened steering torsion bar. Making this track focused supercar’s responsiveness instant and true. The cabin is alive with sound and feel from the stunning powertrain. Each sensation is made more vivid by classic LT elements. Like the stiffer engine mounts and polycarbonate glazing. While the dramatic new quad-exit full-titanium exhaust gives spine-tingling voice to all 765PS. And adds to the sheer visual drama. Grip and cornering ability are next-level – with bespoke Pirelli P Zero™ Trofeo R tyres. The 765LT is changing the game in driver engagement.",
